## Incident Response FAQ

Downtime is not a matter of _if_, it's a matter of _when_.

These are common questions we get from teams launching services about what cloud.gov.au provides, what your responsibilities are when launching services, and how we respond when things go wrong.

### How do I find out about problems with cloud.gov.au

We publish status and availability for the platform and applications on [status.cloud.gov.au](http://status.cloud.gov.au).

During incidents, we commit to delivering status updates every 15 minutes.

Things are going to break. We're here to help you get back on your feet.

#### What should I escalate to the cloud.gov.au team?

* A suspected failure of the application runtime environment, that is impacting the availability of your app.

#### What should I _not_ escalate to the cloud.gov.au team?
