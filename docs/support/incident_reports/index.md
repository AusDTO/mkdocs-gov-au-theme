# Intro

The cloud.gov.au team takes the performance of the platform seriously. While we rely on our suppliers to provide software and infrastructure to deliver cloud.gov.au, we own our availability, and we take full responsibility for service performance.

Whenever we have an incident, we run a Post Incident Review to learn about what happened, and what we can do differently.

We do this because we believe there is valuable information to be learnt from failures, which can be applied to improve the systems, tools, and processes that power cloud.gov.au.
