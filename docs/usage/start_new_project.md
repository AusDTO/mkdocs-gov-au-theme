## What we use this information for

When we create a new project we setup your team with access to:

- AusDTO GitHub (place to manage your applications source code)
- CloudFoundry (you will use this for managing your application)

It is important that you nominate a team maintainer in your new project request. The project maintainer has admin access to the GitHub team and CloudFoundry space. This means that they can add and remove team members once the project is setup.

We create a new GitHub team on the AusDTO GitHub organisation. We populate this team with the GitHub user accounts you provide.

When we set up a new CloudFoundry project we use the project name as the CloudFoundry Space name. We create user accounts and grant access to the space using the emails you supplied. We collect the users mobile number so we can send them their new CloudFoundry login password.
